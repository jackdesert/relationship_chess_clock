Relationship Chess Clock
========================

Give each person in the conversation equal opportunity to speak.

Much like a chess clock. But pulls through in important ways:

* Keeps ticking even if your screen turns off
* It's clear about which button activates which partner
* Offers the option of "Both", to share time when nobody knows who's going to talk next
* When one person runs out of time, you can add more time to both partners if
  there are still unresolved topics
