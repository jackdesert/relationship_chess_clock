Why is the period half as much when set to "both"?
--------------------------------------------------


To avoid the distraction that can happen when one time crossed a second
boundary in one period, and the other crosses in the next period (and even more
confusion when period is a bit more than a second so that it goes in and out of
updating them both at the same time and updating them alternatingly)
